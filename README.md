This repository contains the full reproducible analysis from the study:

> **"Comparative Evaluation of Commercially Available Wound Dressings for Exuding Wounds: A Reproducible Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis"**

The analysis compares **25 commercial wound dressings** across five classes (Hydrocolloid, Hydrogel, Foam, Alginate, Hydrofiber) using **manufacturer-derived property data** and **multi-criteria decision analysis (TOPSIS)**.

🎯 **Goal**: To provide a transparent, code-based framework for evidence-informed dressing selection when clinical trial data are limited.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Hydrofiber dressings** (e.g., AQUACEL) ranked highest due to superior **absorption, gelling, and suitability for heavy exudate**.
- **Foam dressings** ranked second, excelling in **cushioning and conformability**.
- **Bootstrap stability analysis** showed Hydrofiber ranked #1 in **86% of iterations**, indicating robust dominance.
- The full pipeline is **reproducible** and designed for reuse.
